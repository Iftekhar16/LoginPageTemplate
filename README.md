# LoginPageTemplate
Practice login page template. First HTML and CSS project
This was inspired from a random youtube video I found
My first instict was "I NEED TO MAKE THISSS"
Though I wasn't able to make a complete replica of that, I am happy with how it turned out as a first project
Changed to logo from a FoodPanda type thing to a Hollow knight logo cause of course I did
